      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever been in the middle of a book series and come across something that you don’t entirely remember? Flipping back through every book to try and find what you’ve forgotten can be very tiring and frustrating. To solve this, I am working on a website that not only can include the information that you’re looking for in an easily searchable way, it will house other useful tools for anyone who is reading or aspiring to become a writer.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience that I will be directing my efforts toward is the consumers of my writing. The people who find it entertaining and wish to know more. It will also be a resource for those who wish to get into writing, themselves, as I will include resources and tips.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
