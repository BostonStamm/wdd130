	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<img alt="This is me." src="images/Me.jpg">
	<h2>Boston Stamm</h2>
	<p>I was born in Utah, though my family moved around frequently until we ended up in Yakima, Washington. We lived in Washington for thirteen years then my family moved to West Point, Utah while I came here to Rexburg.</p>
	<p>I'm currently a Comp-Sci major, though I am going to change it to Software Engineering which is turning out to be a longer process than I thought. I'm currently single and suffering through using Mutual. I work for the school as an Online TA Grader, which is probably the best decision that I've made in the past two years.</p> 
	<p>The thing I love most about this school is the community and the people in it. The advantages I see from a career in web design is that web design is something that will always be prevalent, so there will be no shortage of jobs. I've been a member of the church for all of my life and had the privilege of serving a mission in Rancho Cucamonga, California.</p>
